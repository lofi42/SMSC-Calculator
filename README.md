# 🪂 Social Media Safety Compliance Index (SMSC)

A completely **unscientific**, **meme-driven**, and absolutely **essential** scoring system for paragliders who are tired of getting flooded with *“Uhmm… where is your helmet??”* comments on Instagram.

The **SMSC** tells you how many “safety expert” comments (a.k.a. *Safety Karens*, *Helm Police*, *Keyboard Instructors*) you can expect under your next flight post:

- **Low SMSC → Many stupid comments.**  
- **High SMSC → Peace, silence, no unsolicited advice.**

Created for fun.  
Designed for pilots.  
Feared by Instagram Know-It-Alls.
